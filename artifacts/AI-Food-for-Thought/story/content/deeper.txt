{{game.economy && !game.social->Picture a world where people no longer need to put forth any effort in order to survive. (That's almost the case in some developed countries, but it's not sustainable yet.) Farming, infrastructure, education, ... everything is run by AI. Everything is so cheap that it's essentially free, and nobody has to work a day in their lives to survive. What do people do with their time? {{game.excited->Perhaps they turn to artistic and humanitarian endeavors, and we learn to better communicate as a people. Maybe people spend time pursuing scientific discovery or knowledge.}}{{!game.excited->Maybe people sink further into binge-watching, game-playing apathy and let the world run itself while they become more and more like the denizens of a Fahrenheit 451 dystopia, where the greatest disturbance to their idyllic existence is their existential depression.}} In order to motivate continued economic activity in a world where a small number of people/systems provide the majority of human needs nearly free of charge, it has been suggested that we institute a minimum guaranteed income for all people, encouraging spending on luxury items and continued economic development.}}
{{!game.economy && !game.social->Imagine a world where education is so cheap and easy that it can be done ad hoc. Instead of going to college, you set out to do something and in the course of a few weeks have not only learned everything you need to in order to complete the project, but you've actually completed the project too. Learning academic knowledge (reading, math, etc.) is becoming easier and easier, but it's not clear how we can also get better at teaching interpersonal skills. {{!game.excited->One can imagine a future where we are all very knowledgeable, but don't know how to talk to each other or manage our own emotions.}} I think one of the key ingredients in solving this problem will be changing our "school" paradigm to a "community" paradigm, where education is ad hoc, in the community, with people of varying ages, needs, and experiences, where AI facilitates local mentorship and support.}}
{{game.social->AI already affects our social experience. "Posting", "Facebook stalking", "texting", "tweeting", and "snapping" are all strongly influenced by AI technologies ranging from friend recommendations to facial recognition to augmented reality. Imagine a world where you always know the name of the person you're talking to, where strangers are recommended as candidate friends based on the likelihood that you have a successful friendship{{!game.excited-> (or to maximize a simple objective like how many hours you spend messaging them)}}. Imagine a world where AI autonomously optimizes times to hang out with your friends, schedules those times for you, and picks you up in a driverless car to take you to the optimal rendezvous point.}}
 This is just a hint of what the future might look like.
