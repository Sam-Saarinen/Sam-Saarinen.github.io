I recently had the privilege of being hosted by a Chinese company on a week-long trip to Beijing. This was an awesome experience that left me with a much deeper appreciation of the culture and history of China, as well as the state of education there. There are few things that allowed me to get a lot more out of my trip, and at the suggestion of a dear friend, I include them below for public benefit. In a future post, I hope to elaborate on the many amazing things I learned about China while I was there.

## 1. Learn the Language
I do not (yet) speak Chinese. But before I left, I reviewed vocabulary and some basic grammar every day using language learning software. I had also taken a semester of Mandarin about 7 years ago. Even knowing what sounds to listen for, how to pronounce a word from a phoenetic spelling, and how to recognize a new character if you saw it again helped me to learn new words while I was there (出口 / "Chūkǒu" / exit) and (包子 / Bāozi / buns), for example, I learned while in Beijing and were very useful. My Chinese hosts were especially gracious with my limited language skills and eager to teach me new words, despite having an English translator available for nearly all of my interactions. Even though I was clearly not Chinese (mostly because I don't belong to one of their 50-some racial groups), most of the restaurant staff/store owners/taxi drivers/friends I met over there seemed genuinely appreciative of my simple thank you (谢谢 / "Xièxiè"), frequently replying (别客气 / "Bié kèqì" / you're welcome).

## 2. Bring Translation Apps
This might seem to contradict the previous point, but translation apps have gotten really good. Google Translate features a download/offline mode that I found immensely useful while in Beijing (although I had some data access in China at a slight premium from my carrier). Using the speech-to-text-to-translation mode of the app enabled me to have entire conversations with a Chinese CTO, (战静湖 / "Zhàn Jìng Hú").

## 3. Plan ahead for Jet Lag
This might seem a little drastic, but during the week before my trip, I stayed up an additional 2 hours per day (12 hour time difference from Beijing) until the day before my flight. This meant that when I arrived, I was able to stay up until a normal evening time and then rest well from the very first day. To me, the extra effort was worth it, because I didn't waste any useful time while abroad due to sleepiness or fatigue.

## 4. Be Physically Fit
While I was there, we walked a lot. I also had the chance to see the Great Wall, which may be the most intense hiking path in the world (by design, it travels the steep verticals of the ridges between peaks). It would have been a shame to miss out on the cultural and relational understandings that were made possible by these experiences.

## 5. Learn to Eat New Foods
Practice at home. Use chopsticks. Use Sìchuān peppers. Eat new fruits and vegetables (lychees and hawthorn fruit are much more common in China than in the US). Get used to trying new meats (more in a post to come about that one).

Hope this is helpful!
