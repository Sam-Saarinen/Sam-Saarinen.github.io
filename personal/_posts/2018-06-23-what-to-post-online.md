I'm sure that I hold a number of unpopular opinions, and that each of my opinions is objectionable to someone. This site wasn't designed in an effort to be understood by those people. For my friends and family, I hope that this collection of resources is helpful, either for reference, resource, or because I specifically left something for you here. If you want to change my mind about something, you know where to find me.

For everyone else, you are welcome to browse these pages. As far as I know, the information I post is accurate, and does reflect (at the time of writing) some of what I think and feel. I am not ashamed of that honesty. But if you are reading these pages because you want to get to know me better, I suggest that it might be much more effective to talk to me in person. It is very difficult to evaluate the strength of opinion and emotional gravity of a person, let alone have a conversation with them and clarify misunderstandings, when reading mere text.

Perhaps a better title for the page would have been "read at your own risk" or "don't take this the wrong way", but the pages on this personal site may touch on religion, culture, relationships, and purpose/ethics/morality. I may be openly critical of certain choices, beliefs, or behaviors. I may post something that you think you disagree with. If anything on this site is factually incorrect, or if there are any technical issues with the site, please feel free to email me. But if you want to change my mind about something, please talk to me in person. I would do the same for you. (Except for topics that fall under the AI/Education categories from my professional pages, in which case I would try to prove the point with data that could be objectively communicated using static text; I would afford you the same exception, even if you've never met me.)
