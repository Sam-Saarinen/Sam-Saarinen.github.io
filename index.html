  <p>I'm a social entrepreneur whole ultimate goal is to mitigate poverty worldwide by improving the quality, equity, and scalability of education. My company, <a href="https://edapt.tech">Edapt Technologies</a>, applies cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence research to key educational processes, including adaptive assessment, personalized review, and individualized curriculum. We offer a variety of consulting, research, and software services.</p>

  <p>As a researcher, I'm currently investigating approaches to abstraction and scalability in reinforcement learning, scalable assessment creation, scalable pedagogical evaluation and experimentation, and collaborative/explainable machine learning. I also wrote <em>Education: The Next Hundred Years</em>, available through <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-s-am/1135136001?ean=9781078748520">Barnes and Noble</a> and as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081ZMRYJJ">Kindle Book on Amazon</a>. The book combines insights from my research, teaching, and consulting experience to provide a roadmap for transforming education over the next century using emerging pedagogical and computational technologies.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, composing (raps, choral music, machine-generated music), game design (tabletop and electronic), and writing. I do almost all of that with or for my family.</p>
