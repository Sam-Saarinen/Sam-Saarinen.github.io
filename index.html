  <p>I'm an artificial intelligence researcher whose ultimate goal is to improve the quality of education worldwide.
  I'm currently investigating approaches to abstraction and scalability in reinforcement learning, scalable assessment creation, scalable pedagogical evaluation and experimentation, and collaborative/explainable machine learning. I wrote <em>Education: The Next Hundred Years</em>, available through <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-s-am/1135136001?ean=9781078748520">Barnes and Noble</a> and as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081ZMRYJJ">Kindle Book on Amazon</a>. The book combines insights from my research, teaching, and consulting experience to provide a roadmap for transforming education over the next century using emerging pedagogical and computational technologies.</p>

  <p>I offer consulting services in AI, and I've released a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-artificial-intelligence-small-businesses-video">video course on AI for businesses</a>. I also run <a href="https://edapt.app">Edapt Technologies</a>, a company that makes educational products. Subscribe below to hear about the free apps we're releasing!</p>
  <p>I'm interested in almost everything. I <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/brainoftech/write-a-genius-rap-verse-for-you">write lyrics/raps (well)</a>, beatbox (poorly), and make videogames. I enjoy reading, playing soccer or ultimate, and creating. If you don't know me through my work, you may know me as a teacher (paid or volunteer), or through my public service.</p>
