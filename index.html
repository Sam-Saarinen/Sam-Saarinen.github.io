  <h1>(S)am - how you might know me</h1>
  <p>I'm an artificial intelligence researcher whose ultimate goal is to improve the quality of education worldwide.
  I'm currently investigating approaches to abstraction and scalability in reinforcement learning, scalable assessment creation, scalable pedagogical evaluation and experimentation, and collaborative/explainable machine learning.</p>
  <p>I offer <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/brainoftech/be-the-ai-consultant-for-your-small-business">consulting services in AI</a>. I also run a company that makes educational products, including games. Check us out on <a href="https://patreon.com/irGAMES">Patreon</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm interested in almost everything. I write lyrics/raps (well), beatbox (poorly), and make videogames. I enjoy reading, playing soccer or ultimate, and creating. If you don't know me through my work, you may know me as a teacher (paid or volunteer), or through my public service.</p>
