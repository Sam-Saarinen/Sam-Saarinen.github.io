<h1>Welcome to the Future</h1>
We live in a world run by Artificial Intelligence (AI). And by AI, I mean automated problem solving techniques using algorithms, statistics, and data. I'm not currently talking about robotics, sentience, or anything remotely human-like.

Let me give you some examples. When you want to know something, you search for it on Google (or Bing if you're one of those people). Google uses a statistical model (AI) to predict what pages you will click on, given your search terms, search history, inferred demographic information, and other data. When you go to that page, you're shown an advertisement for a new show based on other shows that you've watched (AI). When you take a photo with your friends, your phone detects the faces in the shot (AI) and automatically adjusts the focus to make them sharper. You upload the pic to facebook, which automatically suggests tagging the friends it thinks appear in the shot (AI). You look for directions to your friend's house, and get a route back that is predicted to be shortest given current traffic and driving speeds (AI). Incidentally, that's how shipping services find your friend's house too, only they're optimizing for total time to visit all of the locations they have to stop at (AI). You step into the matched rideshare car (AI), only to discover that it's one of the experimental self-driving ones (AI). It drops you off at the airport where your flight (scheduled by AI) is then on autopilot for most of the trip (AI).

AI controls what you see, what you read, what you buy, how you travel, what you play, how the products you use are designed and manufactured, how your money is managed, and even many of the people that you meet (and which ones you stay in touch with).

And if it didn't, everything you buy would cost at least twice as much, or not exist at all.

My name is (S)am and I'm an AI researcher at Brown University. Specifically, I'm working on applying AI to improving education. I'm interested in using the cheap and scalable data-analysis and decision-making possible with AI to make assessments better and shorter, personalize education at scale, improve how we teach, and help people remember things that are important to them. AI has a lot of promise for the future. But it's also poised to fundamentally change <em>our economy, our humanity, and our identity</em>.

How do you feel about that?
