# Overview
I'm an artificial intelligence researcher and entrepreneur whose primary goal is to provide quality education to all students worldwide. In addition to core technical competencies in AI and software, I've cultivated soft skills in leadership, client development, and communication.

# Vision
I wrote the book [*Education: The Next Hundred Years*](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-s-am/1135136001?ean=9781078748520), available through [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-s-am/1135136001?ean=9781078748520) and as a [Kindle Book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081ZMRYJJ). The book combines insights from my research, teaching, and consulting experience to provide a roadmap for transforming education over the next century using emerging pedagogical and computational technologies.

# AI Competencies
I have research experience in many flavors of Machine Learning, with a specialization in Reinforcement Learning and Reinforcement Learning Theory. The core of my doctoral work is on the application of machine learning and other innovations to educational problems to improve the scalability and equity of educational innovation.

## Video Course
I created the video course ["Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Small Businesses"](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-artificial-intelligence-small-businesses-video), published through Packt. This course covers several main types of machine learning, and each section discusses a common business problem that can be solved using a technique from the course, including everything from understanding your customers better to making automated recommendations that improve over time. This course also introduces artificial neural networks, t-SNE embeddings, and Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandit processes.

## Relevant Papers
* LAK 2020: ["Applying Prerequisite Structure Inference to Adaptive Testing"](/artifacts/papers/LAK_2020.pdf), a conference paper about inferring prerequisite relationships between assessment items and leveraging those relationships for efficient adaptive testing.
* SIGCSE 2019: ["Harnessing the Wisdom of the Classes: Classsourcing and Machine Learning for Assessment Instrument Generation"](/artifacts/papers/SIGCSE_2019.pdf), a conference paper about combining bandit processes, information theory, and crowdsourcing in order to quickly generate statistically validated assessments.
* ArXiv 2018: ["Personalized Education at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10025.pdf), a brief survey paper summarizing some obstacles and opportunities for Reinforcement Learning to dramatically improve educational outcomes.

## Other Experience
* Reviewer for IJCAI-PRICAI 2020.
* At IM DATA 2019, I delivered an hour-long talk on applications of AI to education, and then moderated a panel discussion on a similar topic.
* I interned as a Data Scientist at Udacity in 2017. My work there involved analysis of data from millions of students to provide better course recommendations.

## Math Expertise
I also have a thorough background in mathematics and probabilistic analysis. I published a few papers as an undergraduate:
* AAAI 2016: ["A Tool to Graphically Edit CP-Nets"](/artifacts/papers/AAAI_2016.pdf), a short conference paper on a tech demo for a web-based tool that allowed editing and analyzing an annotated directed-acyclic-graph structure called a CP-Net.
* AAMAS 2015: ["Probabilistic Copeland Tournaments"](/artifacts/papers/AAMAS_2015.pdf), a short conference paper I contributed to dealing with the computational hardness of a particular probabilistic inference problem.
* J. Phys. A 2015: ["Generating random walks and polygons
with stiffness in confinement"](/artifacts/papers/JPhysA_2015.pdf), a journal paper describing sampling methods for random polygons in 3-space under conditions that model the position of DNA in a viral capsid. This was the culmination of several years of research started when I was 17 years old.

# Software Competencies
* Full-stack development using Ruby on Rails for two single-server projects.
* Fluency in Python, with significant project experience in Java, Ruby, C++, Mathematica, Matlab, and JavaScript.
* Professional experience with Anaconda (Python scientific computing collection), PyTorch (deep learning library), and implementations of a variety of deep learning and other machine learning techniques.
* Experience in Lisp, Visual Basic for Applications, and Racket.
* Knowledge of design patterns, software architecture design principles, and repository management using git.
* Hobbyist game designer/developer.

# Business Experience
I've consulted on applications of AI for Speedio in Brazil, Special A Education in China, and various organizations in the US. I also manage an LLC, including finances and HR.
