This is a page (that will be updated regularly) of books that I've read (and at least partially recommend) on how to do good in the world. While there may be some books that stray into the philosophical and ethical, most of them will be concerned more with the "how" than the "why". Most of the books on list list I can't recommend in my general reading list as they are audience/intent specific, but for me, reading them has been an essential part of my work.

### *Invention and Innovation: A History of Hype and Failure* by Vaclav Smil
Smil explores (through detailed historical anecdote) our tendency to overestimate the impact and benefit of the new. I have a difficult time recommending this book wholesale as I think the main argument of the book isn't necessarily proven (in a logical sense) by the 9 primary examples carefully selected and exposited by the author, but the awareness of constraints and nuance that he brings are most certainly useful. Some of the main ideas from the book:
- Naive belief that all of our problems will be solved by a miracle technology in the next 10, 20, or 50 years typically ignores fundamental physical constraints, the cost and complexity of engineering after a fundamental discovery, the history of work on the problem already, and the economic and political realities the prospective technology will interact with.
- In the case of climate change, in particular, the decarbonization goals set by the UN (and its member countries) are optimistic indpendent of the availability of new inventions. As an example, electrifying transportation by the dates set will require more electric vehicles to be produced each year than all combined vehicle production in any year prior.
- Many hard problems require holistic solutions, involving collective changes in more than one area.
- Even incredible advances in computational technology and AI don't trivialize problems bound by physical constraints - e.g. the search for better refrigerants, where nearly all feasible molecules have been explored, or in-air transportation speeds, where speed and efficiency are directly at odds.
- Real tradeoffs between different forms of wellbeing among different people have to be navigated, and industrial-scale mass-application of technologies often have unintended consequences, sometimes both long-lasting and undetectable for a very long time.
- We tend to overstate the significance of individual discoveries.

I don't agree with all of the conclusions Smil draws, but I find his sober (and counter-culturally concrete) evaluation of technological progress to be quite helpful in rebalancing my expectations for the future.

### *The Power to Get Things Done (Whether You Feel Like It or Not)* by Seve Levinson, PhD, and Chris Cooper
This is more or less a self-help book focused on "Follow-Through", but is informed by both a clinical and consulting background. The punchline of the book is essentially that motivation is temporary and unreliable, so it's important to use moments of motivation to change your future circumstances so that you'll do the right thing when the time comes. One of my favorite examples from the book was a business executive who hated going to the gym, so he decided to keep his deodorant in his rented gym locker. Not having any at home, he would have to physically go to the gym before work anyway or risk the embarrassment of growing smelly. Leveraging your weak motivation into greater follow-through requires some creativity and self-knowledge, but common strategies include involving other people, creating consequences (social or practical), making non-compliance impossible (and removing temptations), and replacing "achievement" goals with "showing up" goals.

In the context of doing good, my main takeaway is that there's strong evidence from psychological research that my good intentions won't result in doing good. I can't personally conceive of the true magnitude of the problems we're tackling --- who can imagine millions of people suffering in a way that's truly more felt than the suffering of one person that you know well? So I need to use my rare rational and sober-minded moments to trick, coerce, and manipulate my future self into doing the right thing by making it near-impossible for my future self to do otherwise.
