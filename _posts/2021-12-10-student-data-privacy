title: "Why Student Data Privacy Matters"

In the US, there are a large number of laws protecting student data and data of minors (who are typically full-time students). The most well known is FERPA, which regulates the disclosure of personally identifiable data by schools that receive government funding (public schools, for example).  As an education consultant and analytics provider, FERPA generally does not apply to me, as the data is anonymized before I see it, but thinking about data access and privacy controls is still a very important part of what I do.
