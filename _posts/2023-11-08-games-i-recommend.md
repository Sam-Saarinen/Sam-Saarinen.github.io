Games are distinct from other media, and unique in their ability to communicate about systems, and to engage the player personally. Games can make players feel accomplishment, remorse, or empathy in ways that other media struggle to capture. Electronic games are generally more expressive than physical games, but I've listed some of each below.

## Electronic Experiences

### Braid

### Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild


## Physical Experiences

### Contact

### Liar's Poker
