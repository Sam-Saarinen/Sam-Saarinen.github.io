This is a page (that will be updated regularly) of books that I recommend reading. Although expanding population, increasing literacy, improving ease of communication, and benefit of history would seem to cause (by simple probabilities) most of the best books of all time to have been written fairly recently, you will also find a few classics (of various ages) here.

## General Reading

### The Bible
Why do I recommend the #1 bestseller of all time? Outside of the possibility of profound spiritual connection, the Bible underlies an enormous portion of contemporary discussion of morality and philosophy. For example, the Bible contains the first recorded statement[^GoldenRule] of The Golden Rule ("do to others as you would have them do to you" - Matthew 7:12), a description of totally altruistic compassion (1 Corinthians 13:4-7), and a call for the equality of rulers and common people under the written law (Deuteronomy 17:18-20). The Bible also reflects a broad array of genres in ancient literature, and tracks multiple threads of cultural history across centruries. That said, the Bible is not for the faint of heart; for readers in all regions of philosophical standing, distance from the culture and context of the original audience(s) turns many of the more opaque passages into massive exercises in confirmation bias on the part of the reader.

[^GoldenRule]: As with just about any statement about the Bible, this claim tends to attract opposition and qualification. For readers interested in a broader historical survey of reciprocation in ethical maxims, there are many indices available upon a quick search for "Golden Rule".

### *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* by Eliezer Yudkowsky
Bear with me, here. Imagine an exploration of a soft-fantasy universe by a cold-minded rationalist that serves as an object lesson in empiricism, cognitive bias, and human nature. Further imagine that this work contains well-written characters that grow over time, have understandable weaknesses, and reason authentically through differences in opinion. Finally, imagine that this 1800-page work is a fan-fiction based on the wildly popular Harry Potter series, and effectively leverages the source material to tell an entirely novel story. This is [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/). Although this book requires a fair amount of investment and cultural context to fully appreciate, I consider this book universally recommended reading.

### *The Evolution of Everything* by Matt Ridley
*The Evolution of Everything* attempts to apply the principles of evolution by natural selection to draw conclusions in a broad array of disciplines and on a broad set of ideas. As an example, the information present in a given piece of technology can be copied and reproduced with modification. Whether due to market forces or natural causes, only some instances of technology survive to inspire imitation, leading to better-adapted design over time. The oceans themselves drive innovation in boat-making.

Although I think some of the claims of the book may be overreaching (or even logical non sequitors), where else can you find specific predictions for education, technology, economics, eugenics, personality, and the internet all in one place? A book that I value for its provocative and thoughtful speculation.
